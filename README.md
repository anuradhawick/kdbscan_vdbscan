# Density-based clustering in scenarios with variable density
This repository contains two algorithms devoted to solve different problems regarding variable-density scenarios.

## K-DBSCAN

Kernel-Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (K-DBSCAN) aims at identifying arbitrarily-shaped groups of points within a significantly sparse sample-space, without previous knowledge of the amount of resulting clusters.

## V-DBSCAN

Variable-Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (V-DBSCAN) is a multi-scale variation of DBSCAN that takes into account the variations in density when moving away from the centroid of the data.

## Implementation details

Both algorithms are implemented to use a euclidean distance by default. If another distance metric is to be used, this is to be set when first generating the instance of the algorithm (along with algorithm-specific parameters). For instance:


.. code:: python
    
    from kdbscan import KDBSCAN
    from vdbscan import VDBSCAN
    from scipy.spatial.distance import cosine
    alg1 = KDBSCAN(h=0.35,t=0.4,metric=cosine)
    alg2 = VDBSCAN(kappa=0.0012,metric=cosine)

    numpy
    scipy.stats
    skimage.feature
    copy.deepcopy
    scipy.spatial.distance
    collections
    sklearn.neighbors
    sklearn.cluster
    termplot
