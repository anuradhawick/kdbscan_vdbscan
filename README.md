# Density-based clustering in scenarios with variable density
This repository contains two algorithms devoted to solve different problems regarding variable-density scenarios.

## K-DBSCAN

Kernel-Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (K-DBSCAN) aims at identifying arbitrarily-shaped groups of points within a significantly sparse sample-space, without previous knowledge of the amount of resulting clusters.

## V-DBSCAN

Variable-Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (V-DBSCAN) is a multi-scale variation of DBSCAN that takes into account the variations in density when moving away from the centroid of the data.
